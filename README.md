# Getting Started with Tic-Tac-Toe

[Live Demo](https://abhishekjoshi07.github.io/Tic-tac-toe-React).

This is a simple react single page application where the user can play a tic-tac-toe game either with the computer(1 player mode) or with his partner(2 players mode).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
